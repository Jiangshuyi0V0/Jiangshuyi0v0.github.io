            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>In September 2022, Visual Capitalist published "Visualized: The World's Population at 8 Billion," a series of visualizations illustrating the global population distribution as it approached the 8 billion milestone. These visuals highlight that over half of the world's population resides in just seven countries: China, India, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Brazil. The article also emphasizes that Asia accounts for 59% of the global population, underscoring significant regional disparities in population density.</p>

            <h3>Data Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Population rounding inconsistencies:</strong> The total populations of some regions may not perfectly add up due to rounding errors, as noted in the disclaimer.</li>
                <li><strong>Rest of region categorization:</strong> The use of "Rest of East Asia," "Rest of Sub-Saharan Africa," and other "Rest of" categories can make it difficult to interpret exact numbers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h3>Idiom Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Use of abbreviations:</strong> Some countries, like "POL" (Poland) or "UKR" (Ukraine), are abbreviated while others are spelled out, which might be inconsistent or unclear for some viewers.</li>
                <li><strong>Confusing use of M (Million) and B (Billion):</strong> While major countries use B (billion), smaller populations use M (million), which might lead to misinterpretation if not observed carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Ambiguous labels:</strong> The label "Middle East 376M" suggests a regional total but includes "Rest of the Middle East 93M" and specific country counts. This can cause confusion in summing up numbers.</li>

            <h3>How to Improve</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Issues:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Population rounding inconsistencies:</strong> Provide a more precise breakdown of population figures or include an explicit note on the specific rounding method used. Using consistent decimal places or adding a small margin of error range can also help clarify discrepancies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rest of region categorization:</strong> Instead of vague "Rest of" labels, explicitly list the countries included in each category. Alternatively, provide a secondary breakdown in a legend or tooltip format to improve clarity.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Idiom Issues:</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Use of abbreviations:</strong> Maintain consistency in country naming—either use full country names throughout or apply abbreviations uniformly. If abbreviations are necessary due to space constraints, provide a key or legend for clarity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Confusing use of M (Million) and B (Billion):</strong> Use a standardized notation across the visualization. For example, adopting "M" for all populations under one billion and "B" for populations above one billion with a clear label in the legend would prevent confusion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ambiguous labels:</strong> Clearly distinguish between total regional figures and individual country figures. Consider using different fonts, colors, or label styles to separate regional summaries from specific country data. Additionally, avoid embedding region totals in the same format as individual country populations to reduce ambiguity.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>"It Fell from the Sky" is a data visualization project by Luiz Amorim that maps 34,000 recorded meteorite impacts on Earth. Inspired by Stephen Hawking's remark on the threat of asteroid collisions to intelligent life, Amorim delved into this dataset to explore patterns and trends. The visualization highlights a noticeable increase in recorded meteorite strikes in recent years, prompting questions about potential causes and future implications. To create this project, Amorim processed the data using Microsoft Excel, plotted the impacts with Java on Processing, and refined the visuals in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

            <h3>Data Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Meteorite count inconsistency:</strong> The infographic states "Visualizing 34,065 meteorite impacts," but it's unclear whether this represents all recorded meteorites or only a subset based on specific criteria.</li>
                <li><strong>Absence of relative scale:</strong> The circles on the world map represent meteorite sizes but lack a clear numerical scale to compare them precisely.</li>
                <li><strong>Material composition breakdown:</strong> The figure states "Iron 84%" and "Nickel 16%" for the Hoba meteorite but omits details about other potential elements in its composition.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Idiom Issues</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> The dark background with teal text and visuals can be hard to read for viewers with low vision or color blindness.</li>
                <li><strong>Map Crowding:</strong> The clustering of meteorite impact points in certain regions makes it difficult to identify specific data points or patterns without zoom functionality.</li>
                <li><strong>Lack of Legends for Dots:</strong> The size gradient for impact markers is mentioned but not detailed sufficiently to help viewers understand its scaling.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Meteorite count inconsistency:</strong> Provide a clear statement on whether the 34,065 impacts represent all recorded meteorites or a filtered subset based on specific parameters (e.g., size, confirmed authenticity, or geographic distribution). </li>
                    <li><strong>Absence of relative scale:</strong> Include a numerical scale or legend indicating the exact size range each circle represents, ensuring viewers can accurately compare meteorite sizes. </li>
                    <li><strong>Material composition breakdown:</strong> Add a more detailed breakdown of Hoba’s composition, mentioning any trace elements or impurities to give a complete understanding of its structure. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> Adjust the color palette to improve readability by increasing contrast between text, background, and visual elements, and consider accessibility guidelines for colorblind users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Map Crowding:</strong> Implement interactive zoom functionality or regional breakdowns to allow users to explore dense impact areas more effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Legends for Dots:</strong> Provide a clear and precise legend explaining how dot sizes correlate to meteorite impact sizes and ensure consistency throughout the visualization.</li>
