                    <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>In September 2022, Visual Capitalist published "Visualized: The World's Population at 8 Billion," a series of visualizations illustrating the global population distribution as it approached the 8 billion milestone. These visuals highlight that over half of the world's population resides in just seven countries: China, India, the United States, Indonesia, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Brazil. The article also emphasizes that Asia accounts for 59% of the global population, underscoring significant regional disparities in population density.</p>

                    <h3>Data Issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Population Density Information:</strong> 
                        While total population numbers are shown, the visualization does not indicate population density, which is crucial for understanding how populated a country truly is relative to its land area. </li>
                        <li><strong>Lack of Detailed Data for Smaller Countries:</strong> The visualization groups several smaller countries under broad regional labels like “Rest of East Asia” or “Rest of the Middle East”, making it difficult to see their individual population data.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Idiom Issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Overuse of Thick Dividing Lines:</strong> The visualization uses thick solid lines to separate different regions and continents, which makes the image appear fragmented and harder to read.</li>
                        <li><strong>“Rest of…” Labels May Be Confusing:</strong> The map uses labels like “Rest of East Asia” or “Rest of Sub-Saharan Africa,” but it does not clarify which specific countries fall under these groups.</li>
                        <li><strong>Confusing color patterns</strong> The visualization uses very similar shades of red within the same continent to represent different regions, making it difficult to distinguish subregions at a glance.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How to Improve</h3>
                    <!-- <h4>Data Issues</h4> -->
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Add Population Density Indicator:</strong> Include a color gradient or shading effect to show density levels (e.g., darker shades for high-density areas). Or use additionaly icons or labels to show the population per square kilometer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Detailed Data for Smaller Countries:</strong> Instead of vague "Rest of" labels, the visualization could provide a footnote or tooltip with population details for grouped regions.
                        </li>
                    <!-- </ul> -->
                    <!-- <h4>Idiom Issues</h4> -->
                    <!-- <ul> -->
                        <li><strong>Use Different Line Styles for Hierarchy: </strong> Dotted or dashed lines for internal country divisions within a continent, where using solid bold lines only for separating continents, making the hierarchy clearer.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clarify the "Rest of" Category:</strong> Use a footnote or a small list presenting countries of the "Rest of" Category could improve clarity.</li>
                        <li><strong>Clarify the color patterns:</strong> Maintain a consistent color theme for each continent (e.g., Asia in red, Africa in orange) but introduce greater variations in shades.</li>
                    </ul>

                                        <h3>Background</h3>
                    <p>"It Fell from the Sky" is a data visualization project by Luiz Amorim that maps 34,000 recorded meteorite impacts on Earth. Inspired by Stephen Hawking's remark on the threat of asteroid collisions to intelligent life, Amorim delved into this dataset to explore patterns and trends. The visualization highlights a noticeable increase in recorded meteorite strikes in recent years, prompting questions about potential causes and future implications. To create this project, Amorim processed the data using Microsoft Excel, plotted the impacts with Java on Processing, and refined the visuals in Adobe Illustrator.</p>

                    <h3>Data Issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <!-- <li><strong>Meteorite count inconsistency:</strong> The infographic states "Visualizing 34,065 meteorite impacts," but it's unclear whether this represents all recorded meteorites or only a subset based on specific criteria.</li> -->
                        <li><strong>Misleading Timeline:</strong> The timeline shows a sharp increase in recorded meteorite impacts after 1979, which could mistakenly imply that few meteorites impacted Earth before. However, it mainly due to limited tracking technology and incomplete records in early days. </li>
                        <li><strong>Unclear Meteorite breakdown:</strong> The figure only states the composition of Hoba meteorite but omits details about other potential kinds of meteorite, which mislead that Hoba is the only type of meteorite.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Idiom Issues</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> The dark background with teal text and visuals is hard to read for viewers, especially for people with low vision or color blindness.</li>
                        <!-- <li><strong>Map Crowding:</strong> The clustering of meteorite impact points in certain regions makes it difficult to identify specific data points or patterns without zoom functionality.</li> -->
                        <li><strong>Lack of Legends for Dots:</strong> The figure does not explicitly explain what the bubble and bubble size represent.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>How to Improve</h3>
                    <!-- <h4>Data Issues</h4> -->
                    <ul>
                        <!-- <li><strong>Meteorite count inconsistency:</strong> Provide a clear statement on whether the 34,065 impacts represent all recorded meteorites or a filtered subset based on specific parameters (e.g., size, confirmed authenticity, or geographic distribution). </li> -->
                        <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Remove irrelevant early years with little data and focus on the modern tracking era (post-1970) to make trends clearer </li>
                        <li><strong>Meteorite Types:</strong> Introduce a small pie chart or bar graph showing the distribution of other meteorites and corresponding composition besides Hoba. </li>
                    <!-- </ul> -->
                    <!-- <h4>Idiom Issues</h4> -->
                    <!-- <ul> -->
                        <li><strong>Color Contrast:</strong> Adjust the color palette to improve readability by increasing contrast between text, background, and visual elements, and consider accessibility of color patterns for color-impaired users.</li>
                        <!-- <li><strong>Map Crowding:</strong> Implement interactive zoom functionality or regional breakdowns to allow users to explore dense impact areas more effectively.</li> -->
                        <li><strong>Legends for Dots:</strong> Provide a clear and precise legend explaining the meaning of dots, how dot sizes correlate to meteorite impact sizes and ensure consistency throughout the visualization.</li>
